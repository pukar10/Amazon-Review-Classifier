# Amazon-Review-Classifier
Machine Learning / Data mining - Reads and Labels whether an amazon review is positive or negative. Implements KNN (K nearest neighbors)
to label review.

## Dataset
- train - 17,000 amazon reviews; Labels: +1 for positive, -1 for negative. <br />
- test - 3,000 amazon reviews no labels.

## Approach
2d array to store each review and word. Rows = reviews, columns = words. Use nltk to extract stop words/punctuation and
stem all words (playing = play | running = run). Use textblob to get polarity of each sentence. Create list of features. Plot, 
if majority near it is positive review is positive otherwise negative.

## Libraries
- textblob <br />
- numpy <br />
- nltk <br />
- sklearn <br />
- matplotlib <br />
- pandas <br />
